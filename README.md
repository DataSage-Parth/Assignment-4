## âœ… Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

### ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Opens and reads a file named `sample.txt`.
2. Prints its content line by line in a numbered format.
3. Handles the error if the file does not exist.
# Task 2 â€“ Write and Append Data to a File

## ðŸ’¡ Program Explanation:
This program demonstrates basic file handling in Python:
- Writing to a file using `"w"` mode (write).
- Appending to a file using `"a"` mode (append).
- Reading from a file using `"r"` mode (read).
- It also uses `input()` to accept user input and displays file content after writing/appending.
